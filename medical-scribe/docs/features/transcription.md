## Document Processing

Obscura supports uploading PDFs, images, and text documents for note generation. The processing pipeline is configurable in Settings → Model Settings → LLM tab:

- **Auto (default):** Automatically probes the model for vision capability. If supported, sends document images directly to the vision model. Falls back to text extraction + OCR if not.
- **Vision only:** Always renders document pages as images and sends them to the vision model. Requires a vision-capable model.
- **OCR only:** Extracts text using pypdf with Tesseract OCR fallback. Works with any model but may miss information in scanned documents or images.
